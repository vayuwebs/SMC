/**
 * Put the right better-sqlite3 binary in place for the runtime about to load it.
 *
 *   node scripts/native-abi.mjs node       # tests, seed, CLI scripts
 *   node scripts/native-abi.mjs electron   # the app
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * better-sqlite3 is a native module, so its compiled binary only works with the
 * runtime it was built for: Node 22 is NODE_MODULE_VERSION 127, Electron 38 is
 * 139. The project needs both - the tests and the seed run under Node, the app
 * runs under Electron.
 *
 * The obvious tools do not do this reliably: `electron-builder install-app-deps`
 * and `@electron/rebuild` both report success while leaving the Node binary in
 * place, because prebuild-install sees a binary already on disk and skips.
 *
 * So each binary is fetched once - the published prebuild, see
 * scripts/native-binaries.mjs - cached under .native-cache/, and switching is a
 * file copy. If a prebuild cannot be downloaded (no network, or a runtime the
 * release does not cover) it falls back to compiling from source, which takes a
 * minute or two.
 *
 * Verifying the result needs care: requiring better-sqlite3 is NOT enough,
 * because it loads its binding lazily and the require succeeds even when the
 * binary is wrong. Only opening a database actually dlopens it - which is what
 * scripts/check-abi.mjs does.
