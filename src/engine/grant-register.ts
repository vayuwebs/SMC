/**
 * ગ્રાન્ટ રજીસ્ટર - the receipts register (SPEC 6.3).
 *
 * One row per receipt. Every column but two is a stored fact; the two computed
 * ones are ખર્ચેલ રકમ (how much of this particular receipt was spent) and
 * બચત રહેલ ગ્રાન્ટ (what is left of it).
 *
 * Attributing spending to a particular receipt needs a rule, because money in a
 * bank account is fungible. The rule, per SPEC 6.3:
 *
 *   Per head, apply outflows in date order FIFO - against the opening balance
 *   first, then receipts in date order. Only SPENDING that lands on a receipt
 *   counts as ખર્ચેલ રકમ; a grant return consumes balance without being spending.
 *
 * On the sample year this reproduces the printed register exactly: every grant
 * receipt comes out fully spent, and every interest receipt fully unspent -
 * because the 2,399 interest return consumed only the opening interest balance.
 *
 * NOTE: still to be confirmed with the client (SPEC 11.10).
